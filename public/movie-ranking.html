 <h1>The best movies according to Emmanuel</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>The dark knight</h3>
 <p>Christopher Nolan's approach humanizes Batman, showing his internal struggles and the psychological toll of his vigilante lifestyle, making him a more relatable hero.</p> 
 <h3>The Matrix</h3>
 <p>The core concept of the Matrix, where humans are unknowingly living in a simulated reality controlled by machines, raises profound questions about free will, reality, and the nature of consciousness.</p>
 <h3>The terminator</h3>
 <p>The idea of a machine sent back in time to assassinate a target before they are born was a novel and unsettling concept that captured the imagination of audiences. </p>
